# Perfect Match CV!

## Why this CV is valuable?

I've always been fightging against having:

- A well written CV
- well designed
- readable & Scannable for Recruiters and Tech people
- AND Passing the Parsing for ATS

Even if I'd have it, it's pretty hard to keep up to day, updating just 1 work takes too much times and most of the time I have to do it twice, in English and Spanish, so every change is challenging itself and the real value of a CV is fiding interviews, it has nothing to do with anything else listed before, That why I built this for myself, but expecting to make it scalable to share it to everyone!
